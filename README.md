Survey From 

The second project was about creating a survey form. I tried my best to make it as similar to the sample form as possible. 
The form asks users for inputs such as name, email, age(Optional), job, if they would offer freeCodeCamp to a friend, favorite freeCodeCamp feature, improvments, and if they have other suggestions.
And they should submit the form after filling it.
